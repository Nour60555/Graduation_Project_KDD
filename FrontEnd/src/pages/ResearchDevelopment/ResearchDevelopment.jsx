        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool for early detection and prognosis of
          chronic kidney disease (CKD), offering considerable improvements in diagnostic accuracy and patient outcome predictions.
          By integrating vast amounts of patient dataâ€”imaging studies, laboratory results, and genetic informationâ€”
          AI-driven systems can identify subtle patterns that traditional diagnostic methods might overlook.

        <h2>2. Literature Review</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated high accuracy in CKD detection.
          ML techniques like <strong>support vector machines (SVM)</strong> and <strong>artificial neural networks (ANN)</strong>
          can analyze complex, non-linear data, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at detecting early damage in renal imaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ensemble methods combine multiple AI models to enhance predictive performance, while feature selection techniques
          improve model interpretability and clinical trust.

        <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          This research follows a systematic approach using the <strong>PRISMA framework</strong> for structured review and meta-analysis.
          Data sources include Scopus (2021â€“2026) with 534 relevant documents analyzed. Bibliometric tools like VOSviewer and
          Publish or Perish were used to identify trends, impactful studies, and key authors.
